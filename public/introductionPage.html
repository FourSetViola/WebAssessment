        <h2 class="sectionTitle">About myself</h2>
        <p class="sectionPara">I'm currently a student studying at South China Normal University Aberdeen Institute. 
         I live in Shenzhen, so it's quite lucky for me to study at an university near my city. Getting a chance to experience a new environment while staying close to home always sound good.</p>
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">What do I study</h2>
        <p class="sectionPara">I major in Computer Science(More precisely Software Engineer-<br>ing if according to SCNU's specification). 
        I decided to search for a career in Computer Science when one of my teachers at my high school taught us a little bit of Python, I felt like that maybe I'm suitable for doing stuffs like this at that time. </p>
        <p class="sectionPara">Now I've learned programming languages like Py, Java, C and C++. I have also taken important lectures like Dara Structure and Algorithm, Computer Architecture and Database. 
        But the more I learn, the less I realized I've learned. Sometimes it's frustrating, but I think maybe the pressure is positive.</p>
        <p class="sectionPara">But afterall, Web Application Development is a lot of fun to me. It's easy to get started and see your progress, sometimes you need some sense of achievement to drive you on. 
        Also there's bunches of handy front-end frameworks like Vue or React, which makes it even easier to make decent webpages. </p>

      <!-- This is the second article of the introduction page -->
      <article class="block" style="display: block; background-color: #2c2c2c; border: 3vw;">
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">What's this website about</h2>
        <p class="sectionPara">This website consists of three pages: the Introduction Page, the About Page. The Introduction Page simply tells whom am I and the overview of the website.
        The About Page tells more about my passion and my hobbies. The Quiz Application is a simple quiz application that you can challenge yourself to several questions on football as
        I thought this would be a topic that most boys are interested in. If you find the quiz application became a torture for people who don't know football, I sincerely apologize for that.</p>
        <p class="sectionPara">Inside the Quiz Page, you would be asked to answer a set of questions in a fixed time limit for each question. At the end of the quiz, you'll be able to see the leaderboard
        of the quiz which would show the 3 top players of the quiz. Let's try to clinch a place in the leaderboard.</p>
