        <h2 class="sectionTitle">About myself</h2>
        <p class="sectionPara">I'm currently a student studying at South China Normal University Aberdeen Institute. 
         I live in Shenzhen, so it's quite lucky for me to study at an university near my city. Getting a chance to experience a new environment while staying close to home always sound good.</p>
        <p class="sectionPara">Besides days on campus, I've also taken up various hobbies. I believe that it is what I learn and what I enjoy that makes who I am. I enjoy exploring the outer world and my inner self as much as I enjoy programming. 
        I've played instruments like the violin and the viola in the orchestra for like six years. I can also speak several languages like English, Japanese, dialects like Cantonese and Haka to have more chance to expose myself to another culture when I go on travelling.

      <article class="block" style="display: block; background-color: #2c2c2c; border: 3vw;">
        <h2 class="sectionTitle">What do I study</h2>
        <p class="sectionPara">I major in Computer Science(More precisely Software Engineer-<br>ing if according to SCNU's specification). 
        I decided to search for a career in Computer Science when one of my teachers at my high school taught us a little bit of Python, I felt like that maybe I'm suitable for doing stuffs like this at that time. 
        'Ignorance is strength', like George Orwell wrote in his novel.</p>
        <p class="sectionPara">Now I've learned a lot of  programming languages like Py, Java, C and C++. Also I have taken important lectures like Dara Structure and Algorithm, Computer Architecture and Database. 
        But the more I learn, the less I realized I've learned. Sometimes it's frustrating, but I think maybe the pressure is positive.</p>
        <p class="sectionPara">But afterall Web Application Development is a lot of fun to me. It's easy to get started and it's to see your progress, sometimes you need some recognition or sense of achievement to drive you on. 
        Also there's bunches of handy front-end frameworks like Vue or React, which makes it even easier to make decent webpages. </p>
