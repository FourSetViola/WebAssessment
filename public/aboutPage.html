            <h2 style="font-size: 2.5vw;">More About Me</h2>
            <h3 style="font-size: 2vw;">A semi-pro orchestra player</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">For me, the best time I had back in my high school is playing in the school's orchestra. 
            That expreience has greatly shaped whom I am and taught me how to work in a team. <br>
            The orchestra of my high school is a semi-pro orchestra that most of the members would apply for Conservatories after they graduate,
            to get admitted into the orchestra, students would need to pass several tests like tuning and sight-reading(playing a new piece).
            Regular auditions would also be conducted to determine the principles of each sections and the squad for important competitions.<br>
            I became the vice-principle of the Viola(it's not a typo) section by the time I got admitted into the orchestra and then the principle 3 years later.
            Knowing the fact that being the leader of your senior players, it's not an easy job to do with the pressure and the responsibilty to come.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 2vw;">A so-called 'PetrolHead'</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">I enjoy programming and I find joy in learning Computer Science, but actually, if it hadn't been the trend of Electrical Vehicles,
            it would have been a dream-come-true for me to major in Vehicle Engineering. I'd learned too much details on the architecture of a car, like how conbustion engine
            works, models of suspension at an early age. I like every single part of the car and I'm obessed with the feedback from these parts when I drive. It's the pure
            communication between human and machine.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">Cars can take you to places further than you'd expected and they're able to maintain their charm even decades have passed. The design
            languages of decent cars in the past are still outstanding, even up to today's standard.  Every time I travelled abroad, I'm lucky enough to encounter some absolute
            rare cars, so although it might sound weird, I actually began to like travelling and photography because of cars.</p>
