            <h2 style="font-size: 2vw;">A semi-pro orchestra player</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">For me, the best time I had back in my high school is playing in the school's orchestra. 
            That expreience has greatly shaped whom I am and taught me how to work in a team. <br>
            The orchestra of my high school is a semi-pro orchestra that most of the members would apply for Conservatories after they graduate,
            to get admitted into the orchestra, students would need to pass several tests like tuning and sight-reading(playing an unknown piece).
            Regular auditions would also be conducted to determine the principles of each sections and the squad for important competitions.<br>
            I became the vice-principle of the Viola(it's not a typo) section by the time I got admitted into the orchestra and then the principle 3 years later.
            Knowing the fact that being the leader of your senior players, it's not an easy job to do with the pressure and the responsibilty to come.</p>
